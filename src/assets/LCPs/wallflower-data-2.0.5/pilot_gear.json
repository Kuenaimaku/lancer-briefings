    "description": "A remarkably potent spirit distilled by Mir Bahadur, this moonshine is served to discerning customers and traded for favors within Evergreen's informal barter networks. It goes down surprisingly smooth with notes of vanilla and spices and is responsible for a truly impressive number of hangovers and bad decisions. While piloting under the influence is highly inadvisable, a bottle of good alcohol can be a boon to morale as well as a valuable trade commodity. Bahadur’s homebrew can even serve as a disinfectant or crude (if effective) anesthetic, and it is high enough proof to run a biofuel generator or even be repurposed into a makeshift incendiary device in a pinch.",

Over the centuries, a variety of tools and techniques have been developed to assist with this. One of these techniques involves the consumption of a native species of psychedelic fungus, either dried or brewed as tea. This substance, commonly called locus, induces feelings of opennness, euphoria, enhanced empathy, and altered sensory perceptions including mild hallucinations and synaesthesia. Locus is not habit-forming nor does it have any harmful long-term effects, though some users experience headaches and fatigue after use. That said, overdosing can lead to bouts of “empathic overload”, dissociation, and more severe hallucinatory episodes.</p><p>In humans, ingestion of locus induces a state of enhanced affinity for Witness, though it does not necessarily grant a deeper understanding of its use. The effects last from three to six hours depending on the strength of the dose, the user’s metabolism, and other factors. Locus also has a variety of other therapeutic uses.</p>",
